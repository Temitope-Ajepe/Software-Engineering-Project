Implementing a video game for a software engineering project

# Project Title:
Tower Clash

## Project Description
Tower clash is a video based game developed usig C++ and SMFL library. In this game, the GOOD BOYS defend
valuable resources from the BAD BOYS, while also deploying more GOOD BOY soldiers to strengthen their defenses.
Players must adjust their strategy as the BAD BOYS take different routes to reach the resources, dynamically 
changing the battlefield and requiring quick thinking.

## Unique Features:
- Deploy GOOD BOYS soilders to defend resources.
- BAD BOYS soilders take resources through different routes.
- Build castles paths strategically to block BAD BOYS soilders from taking resources.
- Enemies paths change dynamically, when routes are blocked and also players need to think faster to
defend the resources from the new routes.
- Decide where to place castles and how to allocate defenders to protect resources effectively.

## How to Play:
- Place GOOD BOYS soilders around the resources to defed them.
- Build castles to block the BAD BOYS soilders paths. you can't build castles or deploy 
GOOD BOY soilders everywhere, so think strategically and choose where to place them.
- Observe the BAD BOYS soilders paths and adjust your defense strategy accordingly.
- The game ends when all resources are taken by the BAD BOYS soilders, or when the GOOD BOYS soilders
successfully survive multiple waves of attack from the BAD BOYS soilders and protect the resources.

## Installation Process:
- Ensure you have a C++ development environment set up on your laptop.
- Install the SFML library by following the instructions given to us by the Professor which is attached
to the files uploaded on Teams.
- Ensure you create a repository on Github, collaborate with your project partner if you are working with 
one and clone it to your local machine. e.g *** git clone git@github.com:temitope6878/Software-Engineering-Project.git ****
- Ensure you have Git installed on your local machine to push your code to the repository

## Technologies Used:
- C++
- SFML Library
- Git and GitHub
- Visual Studio

## Future Developments:
- Implement the game using C++ and SFML Library.
- Add multipe GOOD BOYS and BAD BOYS soilders with different abilities and strengths (not decided yet).
- Introduce various BAD BOY enemy types with unique behaviors.
- Implement dynamic pathfinding for enemies when routes are blocked.
- Include a scoring system based on waves survived and resources protected.
- Add upgrades for castles and soldiers using collected resources.
- Develop a simple graphical user interface for menus, game over screens, and wave information.
- Add saving/loading of game progress.
