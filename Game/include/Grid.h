// These constants tell the Pathfinding how big the squares are.
// Based on your Game.cpp, these are the correct numbers:
const int GRID_SIZE = 40;   // Each square is 40x40 pixels
const int COLS = 20;        // 20 * 40 = 800 (Your window width)
const int ROWS = 15;        // 15 * 40 = 600 (Your window height)
